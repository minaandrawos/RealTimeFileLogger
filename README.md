# RealTimeFileLogger


Real Time File logger or rtfilelogger for short, is a simple desktop application written in Python. The tool allows you to read log files in real time. It also allows you to pause or resume reading log files. The tool is cross-platform, and doesn't need any third party packages to run.

**How to run:**

 - Make sure you have Python 3.
 - Clone this repository.
 - Run `python rtfilelogger.py`

That's it. The project does not use any third party packages. It relies on Tkinter for the UI, which comes pre-loaded with Python, and a number of Python built-in packages for the functionality.
