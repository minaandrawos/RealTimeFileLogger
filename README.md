# RealTimeFileLogger


Real Time File logger or rtfilelogger for short, is a simple desktop application written in Python. The tool allows you to read log files in real time. It also allows you to pause or resume reading log files.

**How to run:**

 - Make sure you have Python 3.
 - Clone this repository.
 - Run `python rtfilelogger.py`

That's it. The project does not use any third party packages. It relies on Tkinter for the UI, which comes pre-loaded with Python, and a number of Python built-in packages for the functionality.

 2. *Play/Pause*:  Pauses or resumes the read operation for the currently selected file.
