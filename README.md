# RealTimeFileLogger


Real Time File logger or rtfilelogger for short, is a simple desktop application written in Python. The tool allows you to read log files in real time. It also allows you to pause or resume reading log files. The tool is cross-platform, and doesn't use third-party packages.

**How to run:**

 - Make sure you have Python 3.
 - Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/minaandrawos/RealTimeFileLogger.git`.
 - Run `python rtfilelogger.py`, assuming that the `python` command invokes python3 in your terminal, otherwise the command is likely `python3`
 - In Linux, you might need to run `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`.

That's it. The project does not use any third party packages. It relies on Tkinter for the UI, which in a lot of cases comes pre-loaded with Python.

The tool consists of only two buttons:

 1. *Add New File*: Opens a new file for monitoring. The file will open in a new tab.
 2. *Play/Pause*:  Pauses or resumes the read operation of the currently selected file.
